Description: An R package for creating covariate objects for analytics pipelines
    that reference extension tables in OMOP CDM databases. This package extends the
    FeatureExtraction framework to support custom extension tables that are not part
    of the standard CDM schema. The intent of the package is to support working groups
    and use cases that rely on data elements that do not align with the standardized
    data model and require custom data structures that extend OMOP.
